This is a basic attempt for making some association results,again based
on 2nd sem marks of my batch.  
Test 1  
Good in Maths implies Good in Programming  
Now for this test i used values above mean of the class as good for
both the exams.Open Office Spreadsheet was used for the tests.  
Observation 1:Total sample size =35  
Observation 2:Good in Maths =28  
Observation 3:Good in Prog. =25  
Thus support(good in maths)=28/35 and support (good in prog)=25/35  
Observation 4:Good in Prog. and Maths=23  
Support(good in maths and prog)=23/35  
Now the confidence of the association(good in maths-\>good in prog)
is:support(good in maths and prog)/support(good in maths)=23/28 which is
appx. :0.821428571

Test 2  
Finding confidence of the inverse relation(good in prog-\>good in
maths)  
For this we have ,required confidence=support(good in maths and
prog)/support(good in prog)=23/25=0.92

**Thus this random test reveals that the association rule that good
programmers are good mathematicians is much better than it's inverse.**

N.B.:This test does not reveal the larger picture for which more test
data is required.Also **Simpson's paradox** has not been taken into
consideration.  
Programmers Rock!  
More association rules coming soon.
