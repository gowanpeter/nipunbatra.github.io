[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) organised a [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/belkin-energy-disaggregation-competition) on [energy disaggregation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonintrusive_load_monitoring) last year in association with Belkin. 165 teams participated in this contest. I review and categorise some of top solutions whose descriptions have been made [publicly available](https://www.kaggle.com/c/belkin-energy-disaggregation-competition/forums/t/6168/congrats-jessica) on the Kaggle forums by the respective participants. The following table compares the approach and features used by the top 4 rankers in the competition.

It would be interesting to get this data set in nilmtk and see how our benchmark algorithms perform and is on my to do list.
