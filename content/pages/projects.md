### Energy Disaggregation

The aim of energy disaggregation (or Non-intrusive load monitoring
(NILM)) is to break down the household energy measured at a single point
into constituent appliances. The following image demonstrates the same.
Such disaggregated feedback can greatly help the consumers to optimize
their consumption.

If you would like to play around, try this minimal dashboard
app: <http://energy.iiitd.edu.in:5002/visualize> (For now just click on
View data without changing any options)

Feeling the need for an end to end pipeline for such problems, along
with Jack and Oliver, I have been working on a NILM toolkit [[Github page]](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk)[[Documentation](http://nilmtk.github.io/nilmtk/)

Previously, I had worked on simplifying NILM via load division.[[Publication]](http://nipunbatra.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/icmla.pdf) [[Github page]](https://github.com/nipunreddevil/indic) [[IPython notebook]](http://www.iiitd.edu.in/~amarjeet/Research/indic.html)

### Understanding energy consumption in Indian homes

Ever wondered how many hours of power outage does a home in India have?
What about the voltage and power fluctuations in India? Did you know how
significantly you can cut down your overall electricity bills by mildly
adjusting your AC temperature?  
To answer such questions, we have been involved in deployments, both in
the residential as well as in the office like settings.
