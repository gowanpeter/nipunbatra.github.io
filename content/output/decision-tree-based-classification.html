</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Now having done the descriptive analysis comes the more important task
of classification of data. What I did was created a decision tree model
of 4 subjects marks and using it predicted whether the 5th subject marks
are lesser or greater than 55 (POM explains the reason for lower
classification point).</p>
<p>I split my database into two, one for training containing 25 elements and
the other for testing containing 10 elements. 
Firstly I made a decision tree of depth 1 which looks like.</p>
<p>{% img http://nipunbatra.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/1.png [1] %}</p>
<p>In all these decision trees v4,..v7 means subject 1 through subject 4. 
Now this tree clearly uses subject 2(v5) for determining the class(>
or \&lt; than 55 marks for subject5). What it says is that all that who got
less than 68 in subject 2 got less than 55 with an accuracy of
84%(MCE=16%). 
When this fitting function was used on test data,it yielded a poor
performance of 50% prediction accuracy. So a deeper decision tree was
required. 
The next figure is a decision tree of depth 2.</p>
<p>{% img http://nipunbatra.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/2.png [2] %}</p>
<p>Now the prediction improved to 80% on test data and on training data it
was 92%. 
Still it could be improved.So next a decision tree of depth 3 was made
as shown in next figure.</p>
<p>{% img http://nipunbatra.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/3.png [3] %}</p>
<p>This did not improve the prediction capability on the test data though on
training data it obviously improved and was 96%. 
The final decision tree I made was of depth 4 which actually turned out
to be a case of overfitting. It is shown next.</p>
<p>{% img http://nipunbatra.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/4.png [4] %}</p>
<p>Thus the analysis using <strong>binary greedy decision trees</strong> revealed a
classification rule as per figure 3 or fig2 with an accuracy of 80% or
Misclassification error of 20%. </p>
<p><strong>The above analysis was done using R</strong></p>
