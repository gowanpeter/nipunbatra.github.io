</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I am happy to announce my new tech. report entitled- A comparison of NILM methods for commercial and residential buildings. I had the privilege to work with <a href="http://www.marioberges.com/">Mario Berges</a>, <a href="http://blog.oliverparson.co.uk/">Oliver Parson</a> and his supervisor, alongside my supervisor on this report. The paper can be found on arxiv <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6595">here</a>. This paper also accompanies the release of <a href="http://combed.github.io/">Commercial Building Energy data set (COMBED)</a>. I have also recently developed a converter for this data set for usage with NILMTK, which is also available on the data set page.</p>
<p>The paper abstract reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Non intrusive load monitoring (NILM), or energy disaggregation, is the process of separating the total electricity consumption of a building as measured at single point into the building's constituent loads. Previous research in the field has mostly focused on residential buildings, and although the potential benefits of applying this technology to commercial buildings have been recognised since the field's conception, NILM in the commercial domain has been largely unexplored by the academic community. As a result of the heterogeneity of this section of the building stock (i.e., encompassing buildings as diverse as airports, malls and coffee shops), and hence the loads within them, many of the solutions developed for residential energy disaggregation do not apply directly. In this paper we highlight some insights for NILM in the commercial domain using data collected from a large smart meter deployment within an educational campus in Delhi, India, of which a subset of the data has been released for public use. We present an empirical characterisation of loads in commercial buildings, highlighting the differences in energy consumption and load characteristics between residential and commercial buildings. We assess the validity of the assumptions generally made by NILM solutions for residential buildings when applied to measurements from commercial facilities. Based on our observations, we discuss the required traits for a NILM system for commercial buildings, and run benchmark residential NILM algorithms on our data set to confirm our observations. To advance the research in commercial buildings energy disaggregation, we release a subset of our data set, called COMBED (commercial building energy data set).</p>

<p>Happy to hear feedback about this paper!</p>
