Having made a histogram,the next step has to be plotting frequency
polygon for the same data.Again simple stuff,though this time it
required fooling the histogram function. 
This is the analysis with bin width of 5 and following it in the image
gallery is the one with bin width of 1.

Also a side by side comparison of the histogram and the freq. polygon
is shown next.

And now the Cumulative plot is made. The cumulative plot clearly
confirms the median to be around seventy and would be extremely useful
in determining percentile relation with marks.
