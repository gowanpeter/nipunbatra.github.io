Hart originally presented his NILM work way back in 1992. Since then,
the field has grown enormously and is growing quicker with each passing
year. In this small post, i try to show how NILM research is trending.
My approach is simple. I see the citation count/year of Hart's original
paper (which i think would be cited by every work in this
domain).

Since 2010, more than 50 papers per year are citing Hart's paper (which
in some sense approximates to trends in NILM and computational
sustainability). REDD dataset for NILM was released in 2011 and it is
clear why these numbers shoot up after that time. Curious to know why
2010 had a lot of work and what really triggered this change.
