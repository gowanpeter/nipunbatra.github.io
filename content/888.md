Picked up a very interesting problem from SPOJ called three fat ladies.  
Objective: Given input k,tell the kth number whose cube ends with 888.  
Now using the traditional cubing and division would obviously be timed
out,so an optimization was needed.  
1.Clearly number must end with 2  
2.Computing first few terms showed the pattern:192,442,692,942,1192 and
so on.So the problem was merely reduced to string manipulations with
minimum calculations.  
Here is the Python code for the same
```python
a=int(raw_input())
for i in range(0,a):
    b=int(raw_input())
    if (b-1)%4==0:
        str1="192"
    elif (b-1)%4==1:
        str1="442"
    elif (b-1)%4==2:
        str1="692"
    else :
        str1="942"
    if b<=4:
        print str1
    else:
        str2=str((b-1)/4)
        print str2+str1
```

Now this gave a time of .07 on the server, so clearly it's not very
optimized.  
A much better solution could involve using modular exponentiation. The
problem is of the form x\^y%n which is polynomial in nature. Looking
forward to better code or algo than this.
