Just picked up a problem from Project euler.Problem no:10

Here's the statement:

Find the sum of prime numbers below 2 million.

Now when next time someone tell you that algorithms are important pay
heed. I ran my program and ....

it took about an hour to produce the result.The reqd answer
being:142913828922  
Still figuring out how to solve it without using brute force.Prime
numbers have given me a lot of trouble of late,and am still trying hard
to find and implement better algorithm for generation of prime
numbers.If anyone's got a non-brute force solution,do leave it as a
comment here.
