In this post I summarize the contribution of buildings to the overall energy footprint. Various systems such as transportation, manufacturing, buildings contribute to the overall energy consumption. Energy consumption is comprised of electricity, water, gas, etc. Â The following figure shows the percentage contribution of buildings to overall energy consumption across 5 countries.

The contribution of buildings to overall energy consumption in India is
significantly higher than the number in Australia.  
All of the above numbers are referred from the various Country reports
on Building Energy Codes which are as follows:

1.  [India][]
2.  [USA][]
3.  [China][]
4.  [Korea][]
5.  [Australia][]

Building space is being added at an alarming rate and these numbers are
only expected to grow (unless measures are taken).

Following is the code (and data) used to generate the above plot.
