I had my PhD qualifiers recently on "Data Driven Energy Efficiency in Buildings". The role of this qualifiers is to assess a candidate's understanding of the field in general. It is intended to bring the candidate closer to defining the PhD problem statement.

The following video which I created specifically for this presentation shows what data can do to buildings.

The report can be found on [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7227). I used the [following](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75845627/compre/Data%20Driven%20Energy%20Efficiency%20in%20Buildings.pdf) set of slides for the presentation.

The abstract of the report is as follows:

>Buildings across the world contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption and are thus stakeholders in grid operations. Towards the development of a smart grid, utilities and governments across the world are encouraging smart meter deployments. High resolution (often at every 15 minutes) data from these smart meters can be used to understand and optimize energy consumptions in buildings. In addition to smart meters, buildings are also increasingly managed with Building Management Systems (BMS) which control different sub-systems such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). With the advent of these smart meters, increased usage of BMS and easy availability and widespread installation of ambient sensors, there is a deluge of building energy data. This data has been leveraged for a variety of applications such as demand response, appliance fault detection and optimizing HVAC schedules. Beyond the traditional use of such data sets, they can be put to effective use towards making buildings smarter and hence driving every possible bit of energy efficiency. Effective use of this data entails several critical areas from sensing to decision making and participatory involvement of occupants. Picking from wide literature in building energy efficiency, we identify five crust areas (also referred to as 5 Is) for realizing data driven energy efficiency in buildings : i) instrument optimally; ii) interconnect sub-systems; iii) inferred decision making; iv) involve occupants and v) intelligent operations. We classify prior work as per these 5 Is and dis-cuss challenges, opportunities and applications across them. Building upon these 5 Is we discuss a well studied problem in building energy efficiency -non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and how research in this area spans across the 5 Is.

Since the report is on arxiv, I would be happy to incorporate any feedback!
