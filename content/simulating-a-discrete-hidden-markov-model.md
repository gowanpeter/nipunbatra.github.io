In this post we shall create a Hidden Markov Model [1] for the Unfair
Casino problem [2]. In short the problem is as follows: In a casino
there may be two die- one fair and the other biased. The biased die is
much more likely to produce a 6 than the other numbers. With the fair
die all the outcomes (1 through 6) are equally likely. For the biased
die, probability of observing a 6 is 0.5 and observing 1,2,3,4,5 is 0.1
each. Also, there are probabilies associated with the choice of a die to
be thrown. The observer is only able to observe the values of die being
thrown, without having a knowldge whether a fair or biased die were
used.

In all it matches the description of a discrete Hidden Markov Model. The
different components of the Discrete HMM are as follows:


-   **Observed States** : 1 through 6 on the die faces
-   **Hidden States** : Fair or Biased Die
-   **Prior (pi)** : Probability that the first throw is made from a
    fair or a biased die, which is : Pr (first throw is fair) and Pr
    (first throw is biased), which is represented as a 1 X 2 row matrix
-   **Transition Matrix (A)**: Matrix encoding the probability of the 4
    possible transition between fair and biased die, which are: Fair-\>
    Fair, Fair-\> Biased, Biased-\> Fair and Biased-\>Biased, which is
    represented as a 2 X 2 matrix
-   **Emission Matrix (B)** : Matrix encoding the probability of an
    observation given the hidden state. It is a 2 X 6 Matrix


Next, we import the basic set of libraries used for matrix manipulation
and for plotting.


    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib
    #Setting Font Size as 20
    matplotlib.rcParams.update({'font.size': 20})

Next, we define the different components of HMM which were described
above.

    '''
    Pi : Fair die is twice as likely as biased die

    A  : The die thrower likes to keep in one state (fair/biased), and the tranisition from 
    1. Fair-> Fair : .95
    2. Fair->Biased: 1-.95=.05
    3. Biased->Biased: .90
    4. Biased->Biased=1-.90=.10

    B  : The fair die is equally likely to produce observations 1 through 6, for the biased die
    Pr(6)=0.5 and Pr(1)=Pr(2)=Pr(3)=Pr(4)=Pr(5)=0.1
    '''
    pi=np.array([2.0/3,1.0/3])
    A=np.array([[.95,.05],[.1,.9]])
    B=np.array([[1.0/6 for i in range(6)],[.1,.1,.1,.1,.1,.5]])


Now based on these probability sequences we need to produce a sequence
of **observed** and **hidden** states. We use the notion of weighted
sampling, which basically means that terms/states with higher
probabilies assigned to them are more likely to be selected/sampled. For
example,let us consider the starting state. For this we need to use the
**pi** matrix, since that encodes the likiliness of starting in a
particular state. We observe that for starting in **Fair** state the
probability is .667 and twice that of starting in **Biased** state.
Thus, it is much more likely that we start in Fair state. We use
**Fitness Proportionate Selection** [3] to sample states based on
weights (probability). For selection of starting state we would proceed
as follows:

-   We choose a random value between 0 and 1
-   We iterate over the list of values (prior) and iteratively subtract
    the value at current position from the number which we chose at
    random and as soon as it becomes negative, we return the index. Let
    us demonstrate this with a function.


    '''
    Returns next state according to weigted probability array. Code based on Weighted random generation in Python [4]
    '''
    def next_state(weights):
        choice = random.random() * sum(weights)
        for i, w in enumerate(weights):
            choice -= w
            if choice < 0:
                return i

We test the above function by making a call to it 1000 times and then we
try to see how many times do we get a 0 (Fair) wrt 1 (Biased), given the **pi** vector.

    count=0
    for i in range(1000):
        count+=next_state(pi)
    print "Expected number of Fair states:",1000-count
    print "Expected number of Biased states:",count

    Expected number of Fair states: 649
    Expected number of Biased states: 351


Next, we write the following functions:

-   create\_hidden\_sequence (pi,A,length): which creates a hidden
    sequence (Markov Chain) of desired length based on **Pi** and **A**.
    The algorithm followed is as follows: We choose the first state as
    described above. Next on the basis of current state, we see it's
    transition matrix and assign the next state by weighted sampling (by
    invoking next\_state with argument as A[current\_state])
-   create\_observed\_sequence (hidden\_sequence,B): which create an
    observed sequence based on hidden states and associated **B**. Based
    on current hidden state, we use it's emission parameters to sample
    the observation.


    def create_hidden_sequence(pi,A,length):
        out=[None]*length
        out[0]=next_state(pi)
        for i in range(1,length):
            out[i]=next_state(A[out[i-1]])
        return out

    def create_observation_sequence(hidden_sequence,B):
        length=len(hidden_sequence)
        out=[None]*length
        for i in range(length):
            out[i]=next_state(B[hidden_sequence[i]])
        return out

Thus, using these functions and the HMM paramters we decided earlier, we
create length 1000 sequence for hidden and observed states.

    hidden=np.array(create_hidden_sequence(pi,A,1000))
    observed=np.array(create_observation_sequence(hidden,B))

Now, we create helper functions to plot the two sequence in a way we can
intuitively understand the HMM.

    '''Group all contiguous values in tuple. Recipe picked from Stack Overflow [5]'''
    def group(L):
        first = last = L[0]
        for n in L[1:]:
            if n - 1 == last: # Part of the group, bump the end
                last = n
            else: # Not part of the group, yield current group and start a new
                yield first, last
                first = last = n
        yield first, last # Yield the last group

    '''Create tuples of the form (start, number_of_continuous values'''
    def create_tuple(x):
        return [(a,b-a+1) for (a,b) in x]

Now the main code

    #Tuples of form index value, number of continuous values corresponding to Fair State
    indices_hidden_fair=np.where(hidden==0)[0]
    tuples_contiguous_values_fair=list(group(indices_hidden_fair))
    tuples_start_break_fair=create_tuple(tuples_contiguous_values_fair)

    #Tuples of form index value, number of continuous values corresponding to Biased State
    indices_hidden_biased=np.where(hidden==1)[0]
    tuples_contiguous_values_biased=list(group(indices_hidden_biased))
    tuples_start_break_biased=create_tuple(tuples_contiguous_values_biased)

    #Tuples for observations
    observation_tuples=[]
    for i in range(6):
        observation_tuples.append(create_tuple(group(list(np.where(observed==i)[0]))))

Now we plot the hidden and observation sequences

    plt.figsize(20,10)
    plt.subplot(2,1,1)
    plt.xlim((0,1000));
    plt.title('Observations');
    for i in range(6):
        plt.broken_barh(observation_tuples[i],(i+0.5,1),facecolor='k');
    plt.subplot(2,1,2);
    plt.xlim((0,1000));
    plt.title('Hidden States Green:Fair, Red: Biased');
    plt.broken_barh(tuples_start_break_fair,(0,1),facecolor='g');
    plt.broken_barh(tuples_start_break_biased,(0,1),facecolor='r');

Following is the produced output. Red indicates biased die and green
indicates fair die. We can confirm our HMM simulation by seeing a very
high number of 6 when biased die is used and a similar observation for
other states.
