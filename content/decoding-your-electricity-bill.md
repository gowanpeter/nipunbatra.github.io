Natural resources are fast dwindling and subsequently electricity prices
increasing with the increase in demand. In this series of posts I will
discuss about understanding electricity consumption.

In this post, I analyze my home's monthly electricity consumption. I
shall be dealing with only 1 of the meter, while the analysis for the
other one should be on same lines.  
Let us look at the front side of the bill first.

The back side of the bill contains information regarding the tariff
which is as follows:

Let us analyze the front side of the bill. It contains the follow

1.  Units consumed in billing period: In the above case, it being 405
    units (kWh) for a billing period of 32 days.
2.  Bill breakup: This contains the breakup of the bill as follows:
    1.  Fixed charges: This being 100 Rs. as per the tariff mentioned
        below (on the back side)
    2.  Slab wise energy charge: Electricity keeps getting expensive as
        you consume more. This is as per the slabs described in the
        tariff. For domestic users, it is as follows:
        1.  0-200 units: Rs. 3.70/unit
        2.  201-400 units: Rs. 5.50/unit
        3.  400+ units: Rs. 6.50/unit
        4.  As we can see in the bill, the utility charged 207 units in
            the first slab and the remaining 198 in the next slab (Rs.
            5.50/unit)

    3.  Slab wise power purchase charges
    4.  Time of day charge: I think this is relevant only to commercial
        entities
    5.  Surcharge
    6.  Electricity taxes
    7.  Total amount (which is \#1+\#2+\#3..+\#6)

We can observe that the amount we pay for actual usage (\#2) is about
Rs. Â 1850 which is about Rs. 500 less than the total amount we paid. We
do pay a lot of taxes!

If we observe the tariff in minute details, we can observe that a lot of
entities such as Delhi Jal Board (Water utility), DMRC (Metro) pay for
kVAh as opposed to kWh. The technical difference being that kWh is
active energy whereas kVAh is apparent energy. This suggests that in
these entities, inductive loads contribute significantly.
