Just started with a bit of Data Mining.  
Realized the importance of visualization before we do other standard
statistical analysis.  
Here is what i did.  
The above gallery shows a histogram made for 2nd sem marks of our batch
in PEE.  
The procedure followed was simple  
1.Importing the data in R using read.csv  
2.Using hist() function for plotting the results.  
[gallery columns="2"]  
A simple mean() function over the same column showed how high scoring
this subject was,the mean being 72.3.  
Also the median was found to be 74.  
Much more coming soon.Hope to make a predictive model soon.Any
suggestions where such an analysis could be applied(where data is freely
available)?
