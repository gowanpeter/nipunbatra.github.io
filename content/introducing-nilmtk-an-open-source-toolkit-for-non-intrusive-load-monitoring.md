Today, Nipun Batra, Jack Kelly and Oliver Parson are really pleased to
announce the release of [NILMTK: an open source toolkit for
non-intrusive load monitoring][]. The toolkit will allow researchers to
easily develop algorithms which disaggregate a household’s total
electricity consumption into individual appliances.

Specifically, the toolkit includes:

-   a number of parsers to read public data sets into a common format
-   a suite of statistical functions to analyse such data sets and
    identify potential problems
-   two benchmark energy disaggregation algorithms
-   a suite of evaluation metrics to compare disaggregation algorithms

Further details can be found in the accompanying paper recently accepted
at e-Energy 2014 available via [arXiv][] and [Soton ePrints][]:

-   Batra, N., Kelly, J., Parson, O., Dutta, H., Knottenbelt, W.,
    Rogers, A., Singh, A., Srivastava, M. (2014). NILMTK: An Open Source
    Toolkit for Non-intrusive Load Monitoring. In Fifth International
    Conference on Future Energy Systems (ACM e-Energy). Cambridge, UK.

This release is hopefully just the beginning of the toolkit’s
contribution to energy disaggregation, and as such we welcome feedback
and contributions to all aspects of the project.
