I am a computer science student and as such someone with an inclination
towards software rather than hardware. So if you have a laptop which
heats up soon or may even shutdown due to that read on.Most probably if
you are an AMD user,you must read on. My CPU fan seems to have
accumulated some dust and thus my lappie heats up a hell lot and to
prevent com ponent damage,it shuts down.  
So here i was looking for a solution. My screwdriver didn't work. So i
couldn't clean the fan.  
Had to think of something better. A couple of years back a college
senior had advised me that Algos is a must for each Comp Sci student.
That struck me.  
Here i was with Cormen-Intro to Algorithms. Yes the same book which i
used as a dumbell when i stopped hitting the gym. To prevent the heating
problems now was an elementary physics problem.Who says that Physics is
not required for Comp Science students. It took me less than a min to
balance forces,probably my laptop rested perfectly on Cormen and here i
was done.Now my laptop is at a better height. My laptop fan has enough
free space to dispense heat. My cupboard has space for more books.  
So next time anyone tells you how important Algorithms are,pay heed!!
