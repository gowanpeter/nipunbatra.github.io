Many times questions on Stack Overflow are asked and immediately there
are comments asking about which version of the software the user is
using.  
Following is a small set of lines, which one may use to know the
different versions of s/w. This covers most of the packages a computer
scientist needs.  
It is also very useful to include the o/p of this program, before
distributing code. The users are well aware of all the dependencies and
the versions.  
For instance if some code works on my system and fails on someone
else's it might be a case that they are using some other version of
Python, thus providing such details makes the code more "reproducible".  
For instance 3/2 in Python 2.X is 1.5, whereas in Python 3.X it is 1.  
Following is the small script and the corresponding output.
