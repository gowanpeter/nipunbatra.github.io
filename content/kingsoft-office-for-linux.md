I had been shifting to Windows every time I needed to make a
presentation (non-LaTeX and no-HTML5). Libre Office is good, but,
somehow, I found MS Office much friendlier to use.

Recently, I got to know about Kingsoft office, which is a clone of MS
Office made by a Chinese firm. And really it is a clone.
