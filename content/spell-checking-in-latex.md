Very often one needs to do a spell check in LaTeX. This can ofcourse be
done in some text editor. I use TeXStudio IDE in Ubuntu, but
unfortunately it's spell checker was not picking up mistakes. So shifted
to command line and used the **aspellÂ **utility. The utility has a CLI
and is very fast for editing! All one needs to do is to invoke

    aspell -t -c name_of_tex.tex

It can form a part of the LaTeX build workflow.
